## üåà Hi, I'm Tilde (they/them)

### Bio
Tilde Thurium is a San Francisco based artist, activist, and engineer. By day they are a free and open source software advocate at [deepset](https://www.deepset.ai/). They can probably deadlift more than you. Ask them about how to paint an algorithm, the intersections between mutual aid and biology, or which coast has the best vegan croissants.
